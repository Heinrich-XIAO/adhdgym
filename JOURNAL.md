# adhdgym

## June 11, 2025
Chose ESP32-C3 Seeed XIAO for MCU since I use XIAO for everything. DHT11 for temp and humidity info to estimate the speed of sound for the ultrasonic distance sensor.

The PCB was made as small as possible because why make a PCB bigger than it should be.

First, I designed the case for the PCB. Just the PCB.

Then, I decided I should work on the case for the ultrasonic sensor. I took inspiration from [this]https://grabcad.com/library/simple-cover-for-hcsr04-sensor-1(https://grabcad.com/library/simple-cover-for-hcsr04-sensor-1), and started designing my case for the ultrasonic sensor.

Finally, the logical thing to do was to add everything together, and make the final assembly. This was also the first time I made an exploded view.
